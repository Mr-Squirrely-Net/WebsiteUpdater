//Todo: Add interperter for 
	- @head
		- @header
	- @footer
		- @foot
	- @navigation
		- @nav
	- @scripts
		- @script
	- @content["contentname"]

	-element["nameofelement"]

	They will all look for the file that it's asking for (eg. @head will look for head.html)
	@navigation and @nav will look for navigation.html
	@content["contentname"] will look for the .html that corresponds to the "contentname" 
		(eg. @content["foobar"] will look for foobar.html) 
		at the same time @content["foobar.html"] will look for foobar.html.html cause I don't want to do more work than needed

	each plugin for the new page wizard needs to have the html file called plugin.html
		the program will then parse the file and create a new file based on the information gave and rename the file accordingly
